    <!-- Application Structure Plan: The application is structured as a single-page interactive dashboard with a fixed sidebar for thematic navigation. This non-linear approach allows users to explore concepts at their own pace, rather than being forced through a linear document. Each main section (Microeconomics, Macroeconomics, Economic History, etc.) is further broken down into sub-sections corresponding to core economic principles and areas of interest. For each principle, a concise explanation is provided, with detailed explanations, real-world case studies, historical context, and practical implications directly visible (toggles permanently expanded). Charts (Chart.js) are used to visualize data for relevant quantitative concepts. A dedicated "Key Concepts Glossary" section provides quick definitions. This modular and interactive design enhances usability by breaking down dense information into manageable, explorable chunks and directly addressing understandability through layered detail, historical anecdotes, geopolitical connections, and glossary support. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: 
        - All textual content is synthesized from foundational economic knowledge and the "Economics for Citizen, Investor_.pdf" document, expanded and clarified for comprehensive understanding across historical, geopolitical, and investment dimensions.
        - Scarcity & Opportunity Cost: Goal=Inform/Compare. A Bar Chart (Chart.js) illustrates the long-term impact of small choices (opportunity cost). Detailed explanations and case studies (PS5 Shortage, Bitcoin Pizza, Lost Crypto Wallet) are now directly visible.

                <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
                    This dashboard transforms complex economic principles into an understandable and engaging experience. Economics isn't just about charts and figures; it's the study of how we make choices in a world of limited resources. Here, you can explore the core concepts that shape our daily lives, our financial futures, and the global landscape. Navigate using the sidebar, interact with the data, and dive into real-world case studies to see these ideas in action.

                    <h3 class="font-header text-3xl font-semibold mb-3">Understanding the Economic Systems</h3>
                    <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">Every society organizes its production and distribution of goods and services through an economic system. Most real-world economies are a blend, operating along a spectrum from pure capitalism to pure socialism.</p>
                    <div class="learn-more-content mt-2 p-4 bg-blue-50 rounded-lg border-l-4 border-blue-300 open">
                        <h4 class="font-semibold text-gray-800">Capitalism, Socialism & Mixed Economies</h4>
                        <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 mb-3">**Capitalism** is characterized by private ownership of capital assets, driven by the "profit motive," with prices determined by supply and demand in free markets. It fosters innovation and growth but can lead to inequality. **Socialism** advocates for collective ownership of production means, aiming for equitable distribution, often with central planning and robust welfare programs. Challenges include reduced innovation incentives and bureaucratic inefficiencies. Most nations, including the United States, operate as a **Mixed Economy**, combining private markets with government intervention (regulation, social services) to balance efficiency and equity.</p>
                        <h4 class="font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-2">Case Study: Sweden's Mixed Economy</h4>
                        <p class="text-sm text-gray-700">Sweden is often cited as a prime example of a successful mixed economy. While it embraces free-market capitalism with strong private enterprise and innovation, it also features a robust welfare state funded by high taxes, providing universal healthcare, education, and social security. This blend aims to combine economic efficiency with social equity, demonstrating how market forces and government intervention can coexist to achieve broad societal goals.</p>

                <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-8 leading-relaxed">Microeconomics focuses on the behavior of individuals and firms in making decisions regarding the allocation of scarce resources. It's about how prices are determined, why you choose one product over another, and how businesses compete. Let's explore the foundational forces at play.</p>

                        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">At the heart of economics is the fundamental tension between our unlimited wants and the limited resources available to satisfy them. This "scarcity" forces individuals, businesses, and governments to make choices about how to allocate their finite resources.</p>
                        <div class="learn-more-content mt-2 p-4 bg-blue-50 rounded-lg border-l-4 border-blue-300 open">
                            <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 mb-3">Resources aren't just tangible assets like oil; they also include intangible elements such as time, money, and individual abilities. Anything desired that cannot be achieved effortlessly is considered scarce. This leads to prices rising when resources are limited and influences consumer behavior through the "fear of missing out" (FOMO).</p>
                            <h4 class="font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-2">Case Study: The PlayStation 5 Shortage (2020-2022)</h4>
                            <p class="text-sm text-gray-700">When Sony's PlayStation 5 console launched, demand far outstripped supply for nearly two years. Despite a high price, consumers faced extreme difficulty finding consoles, often resorting to paying inflated prices from resellers. This phenomenon perfectly illustrated scarcity: limited production capacity met overwhelming consumer desire, driving up perceived value and prices, and creating significant "fear of missing out" among eager buyers.</p>

                        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">Because of scarcity, every decision involves a trade-off. The true cost of any choice is not just its explicit price, but the "opportunity cost"—the value of the next best alternative you must give up.</p>

However, as of August 2024, those bitcoins were worth over $690 million. This famous story is an extreme but powerful reminder of the immense potential value lost when choosing immediate consumption over long-term investment.</p>

The subsequent surge in Bitcoin's value turned these forgotten digital assets into multi-million dollar "lost treasures," a stark reminder of the long-term opportunity cost of inaction or oversight.</p>

                        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">The price of everything, from your phone to your food, is determined by the balance between how much of it is available (supply) and how much people want it (demand). These two forces meet to create a "market-clearing price" or equilibrium.</p>

                            <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 mb-3">The **Law of Demand** states that as price rises, quantity demanded falls. The **Law of Supply** states that as price rises, quantity supplied rises. While equilibrium is ideal, markets constantly shift due to factors like consumer income, preferences, production costs, and government intervention. Understanding these dynamics is crucial for anticipating market movements.</p>

This imbalance led to massive price increases and empty shelves. As production ramped up and demand stabilized, prices eventually returned to normal, a classic demonstration of supply and demand dynamics.</p>

                        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">Elasticity measures how responsive quantity demanded or supplied is to a change in one of its determinants, such as price or income. It helps understand market dynamics beyond simple shifts.</p>

                            <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 mb-3">**Price Elasticity of Demand (PED)** measures how much quantity demanded responds to a price change. If PED > 1, demand is elastic (e.g., luxury goods); if PED < 1, demand is inelastic (e.g., essential medicines). **Income Elasticity of Demand (YED)** measures how much quantity demanded responds to income change (normal vs. inferior goods). **Cross-Price Elasticity of Demand (CPED)** measures how much quantity demanded of one good responds to a price change in another (substitutes vs. complements). **Price Elasticity of Supply (PES)** measures how much quantity supplied responds to a price change.</p>
                            <h4 class="font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-2">Investment Relevance:</h4>
                            <p class="text-sm text-gray-700">Understanding elasticity is crucial for investors. Companies selling products with inelastic demand (e.g., utilities, basic food) tend to be more stable during economic downturns as price changes affect demand less. Conversely, companies with elastic demand (e.g., discretionary consumer goods) are more sensitive to price changes and economic cycles. For businesses, knowing their product's elasticity guides pricing strategies.</p>

                        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">In economics, incentives are powerful mechanisms—whether rewards or penalties—that predictably influence individual and collective choices and behaviors. People generally respond to incentives by pursuing their self-interest.</p>

Profit is a primary economic incentive for entrepreneurs, driving innovation and risk-taking. However, poorly designed incentives can lead to "perverse outcomes," where actions taken to meet targets unintentionally create inefficiencies.</p>

                        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">Utility maximization explains how consumers decide to allocate their limited income to achieve the greatest possible satisfaction or "utility" from the goods and services they consume. This is influenced by preferences, prices, and budget.</p>
                        <div class="learn-more-content mt-2 p-4 bg-blue-50 rounded-lg border-l-4 border-blue-300 open">
                            <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 mb-3">Consumers aim for maximum benefit. **Total utility** is overall satisfaction, while **marginal utility** is additional satisfaction from one more unit. The law of **diminishing marginal utility** means additional satisfaction decreases with more consumption, leading to diversified spending. Real-world choices are also influenced by "bounded rationality" and cognitive biases, not just pure logic.</p>
                            <h4 class="font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-2">Real-World Choice: Smartphone Purchase</h4>
                            <p class="text-sm text-gray-700">Consider a consumer buying a new smartphone. They might compare a high-end model with a top-tier camera and processor to a mid-range model that's more affordable but has slightly fewer features. Even if the high-end phone offers objectively more "utility," the consumer might choose the mid-range one because the *additional* utility from the top-tier features doesn't justify the *additional* cost for their budget. This demonstrates how individuals make trade-offs to maximize their satisfaction within their financial constraints.</p>
                             <h4 class="font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-2">Budget Constraints & Consumer Choice:</h4>
                            <p class="text-sm text-gray-700">Consumer choice is fundamentally limited by their **budget constraint**, which represents all the combinations of goods and services a consumer can afford given their income and the prices of those goods. A change in income or prices shifts this constraint, altering the feasible consumption bundles and leading to new utility-maximizing choices. Understanding this allows consumers to make optimal spending decisions and businesses to position products effectively for different income segments.</p>

Firms analyze **costs** (fixed, variable, total, marginal) to determine efficiency. **Profit maximization** occurs where marginal revenue (MR) from selling one more unit equals marginal cost (MC) of producing it. For investors, consistently balancing revenue growth with cost control indicates financial health and potential.</p>

                        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">Inflation is a sustained increase in the general price level of goods and services over time, which consequently diminishes the purchasing power of money. The Consumer Price Index (CPI) tracks typical household expenditures.</p>

                            <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 mb-3">Inflation typically stems from **Demand-Pull** (too much demand), **Cost-Push** (rising production costs), or **Inflation Expectations** (beliefs about future prices). Key metrics include CPI (for consumers), Producer Price Index (PPI, for producers), and Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE, favored by the Fed). Understanding these is crucial for assessing purchasing power and adjusting investment strategies.</p>

                            <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 mb-3">**Aggregate Demand (AD)** is the total spending on goods and services in an economy (Consumption + Investment + Government Spending + Net Exports). The AD curve slopes downward. **Aggregate Supply (AS)** is the total output produced by an economy at various price levels. The short-run AS curve slopes upward, while the long-run AS curve is vertical (at full employment output). The intersection of AD and AS determines macroeconomic equilibrium. Shifts in either curve, caused by factors like changes in consumer confidence, technology, or input prices, lead to changes in output, employment, and price levels.</p>

                            <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 mb-3">**Expansionary Fiscal Policy** (lower taxes or increased spending) stimulates economic activity, typically used during recessions. **Contractionary Fiscal Policy** (higher taxes or reduced spending) cools down an overheating economy and combats inflation. The impact varies; short-term stimulus can be beneficial, but long-term fiscal sustainability (deficits) must be considered. Effects are not always evenly distributed across the population.</p>

While deficits can be necessary for short-term stimulus, persistent high deficits can lead to rising national debt, potentially increasing interest payments, crowding out private investment, and raising concerns about long-term fiscal sustainability. Understanding these dynamics is crucial for evaluating a country's economic stability.</p>

                            <p class="text-sm text-gray-700">The EU ETS is the world's largest carbon market, operating as a "cap and trade" system. It sets a cap on the total amount of greenhouse gases that can be emitted by participating industries. Companies receive or buy emission allowances, which they can trade with each other. This system incentivizes businesses to reduce their emissions cost-effectively, as those who reduce more can sell their excess allowances, while those who find it harder to reduce must buy allowances. It's a leading example of a market-based solution to climate change.</p>
